<!-- BEGIN RELEASE NOTES -->
### [Unreleased]

### [23.7.0] - 2023-07-13

#### Added
- Added pre-commit to the repository and ran across all files
- Code-less, configurable onsite identification: Merchants can add a setting to have Klaviyo listen for email submission on any field on their site simply by providing a CSS selector. This allows Klaviyo to identify visitors without requiring the merchant to insert JS throughout the site.
- Branded events: Events from the cartridge can all be branded (since they are all normalized and sent server-side). This is a big unlock for prebuilt flows. This is default-enabled but configurable because merchants that migrate to this version may want to disable to avoid ‘breaking changes’ in preexisting flows.
- Checkout rebuild link: Started Checkout includes a link to rebuild the checkout.
- Consent at checkout site preference: Sync subscribers to a specified Klaviyo list ID

#### Changed
- Updated the legacy `_learnq` js object to the new `klaviyo` js object.
- Uses V3 APIs
- Better cross-architecture support and improved developer experience: Event triggering logic is standardized across SFRA and Site Genesis, improved code readability & maintainability by eliminating complex and unused code.

#### Fixed
- Event tracking reliability & setup time: Added OOTB tracking for “Added to Cart” (never fired unless a user was logged in on SFRA), increased event reliability by standardizing on backend trigger logic (and server-side events). This logic is not susceptible to front-end customizations, which were one of the most common reasons for events not triggering.
