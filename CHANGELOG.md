<!-- BEGIN RELEASE NOTES -->
### [Unreleased]

### [25.4.0] - 25-04-17

#### Added
- Updates to Klaviyo API 2025-04-15. See https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v2025-04-15/reference/api_overview.

#### Changed
- Added `external_catalog_id` and `integration_key` key/value to the following client-side events
  * Searched Site
  * Viewed Category
  * Viewed Product
  * Started Checkout
  * Added to Cart
  * Order Confirmation

### [24.9.0] - 24-09-17

#### Added
- Added `SiteID` key/value to client-side events
- Added the following fields to the top level of Added to Cart events: `masterProductID`, `productID`, `price`, `productName` for use during segmentation.
- Added `value` and `value_currency` to the following events to unblock attribution value tracking in Klaviyo: Started Checkout, Order Confirmation, Viewed Product, Added to Cart

#### Changed
- Updates API revision to latest (2024-07-15)
- Updates klaviyo.js onsite javascript url to new format

#### Fixed
- Updated error handling for consent at checkout when a phone number is invalid

### [24.1.0] - 2024-01-18

#### Added
- Added X-Klaviyo-User-Agent header to Klaviyo API requests

### [23.7.0] - 2023-07-13

#### Added
- Added pre-commit to the repository and ran across all files
- Code-less, configurable onsite identification: Merchants can add a setting to have Klaviyo listen for email submission on any field on their site simply by providing a CSS selector. This allows Klaviyo to identify visitors without requiring the merchant to insert JS throughout the site.
- Branded events: Events from the cartridge can all be branded (since they are all normalized and sent server-side). This is a big unlock for prebuilt flows. This is default-enabled but configurable because merchants that migrate to this version may want to disable to avoid ‘breaking changes’ in preexisting flows.
- Checkout rebuild link: Started Checkout includes a link to rebuild the checkout.
- Consent at checkout site preference: Sync subscribers to a specified Klaviyo list ID

#### Changed
- Updated the legacy `_learnq` js object to the new `klaviyo` js object.
- Uses V3 APIs
- Better cross-architecture support and improved developer experience: Event triggering logic is standardized across SFRA and Site Genesis, improved code readability & maintainability by eliminating complex and unused code.

#### Fixed
- Event tracking reliability & setup time: Added OOTB tracking for “Added to Cart” (never fired unless a user was logged in on SFRA), increased event reliability by standardizing on backend trigger logic (and server-side events). This logic is not susceptible to front-end customizations, which were one of the most common reasons for events not triggering.

### [21.10.0] - 2021-10-14

#### Fixed

- Order Confirmation event will now correctly fire for orders with coupons.
- Order Confirmation will now correctly fire if product has no primary category.

  - sendOrderEmail from Core emailUtils
  - sendKlaviyoShipmentEmail from SG Klaviyo.js controller
