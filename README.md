# Klaviyo Cartridge for B2C Commerce

This is the Salesforce Certified Commerce Cloud Cartridge to integrate Klaviyo.

## Making updates

1. Follow Klaviyo's standard process of making a pull request and getting it reviewed before merging.
2. Update [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/klaviyo/SFCC_Klaviyo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Details on formatting the changelog (including categorizing changes) can be found here: [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
   1. If this is a change that will not immediately get sent along to Salesforce i.e. not a version update:
      1. Add any changes under the [`[Unreleased]`](https://github.com/klaviyo/SFCC_Klaviyo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased) section. This will be a comparison of the most recent commits to the latest tagged version.
   2. If this is a version update:
      1. Add a new version between `[Unreleased]` and the most recent version. Include the incremented version number following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) practices and the date. Add your changes under this version.
      2. Move any unreleased changes into your version update under the appropriate categories.
      3. Update the `[Unreleased]` link to point from your new version to HEAD e.g. if you're updating to version 1.0.2 you'd update the link from `1.0.1...HEAD` to `1.0.2...HEAD`.
      4. Add a link to your new version. The tag won't yet exist but you can create a link to the tag you will create shortly. Follow the pattern of previous links.
3. Upon approval merge your changes into master.
